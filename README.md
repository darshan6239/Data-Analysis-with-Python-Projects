Data Analysis with Python Projects
This repository contains several projects focused on analyzing and visualizing data using Python. These projects are designed to enhance your understanding of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques in Python.
Projects Overview
Demographic Data Analyzer (demographic_data_analyzer.py)
              This project involves analyzing demographic data to gain insights about population characteristics.
              Tasks include computing summary statistics, finding proportions, and making comparisons between groups.
Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator (mean_var_std.py)
              This project focuses on basic statistics calculations.
              The program accepts a 3x3 matrix and returns the mean, variance, and standard deviation along rows, columns, and for the entire dataset.
Medical Data Visualizer (medical_data_visualizer.py)
              This project uses data visualization techniques to analyze medical information.
              Visualizations include heatmaps and categorical plots to help understand trends and relationships in the data.
Test Module (test_module.py)
              This file contains unit tests for validating the outputs of other projects.
              Ensures that the implemented functions provide correct and expected results.
